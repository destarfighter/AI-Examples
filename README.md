# DeStarfighter-AI-Examples
this repository will be continously updated with AI work-samples and fun projects. Feel free to come back later and take a look!

- Current State -
So far i am designing the structure of the code projects. Most AI work-samples will be in separate projects in the same solution, 
sharing common code through a DLL and tested through a solution-wide Unit-Test project. C/C++ will be the programming language used 
for all implementations. 

The solution-process and results will be displayed with a graphical compontent from SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)
